# Full-Stack Web Developer | Student | Mentor

I am currently open to new full-stack development opportunities in global Tech Products & Startups.

I have hands-on experience in designing, developing and maintaining software by bringing together a vision, strategy, and execution in an unstructured and resource-constrained environment.

I love bumping into challenging algorithmic tasks which makes me think hard and learn something new in the process.

## In my years of experience, I've developed extensive knowledge in

- Full-stack development (NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Django, React, Redux, Rails & HTML/CSS),
- UI and UX Design,
- Product Management,
- Prototyping and Wire-framing,
- Delving into Machine Learning projects,
- A bit of Social Media Management & Marketing.

I am passionate about ideating, conceptualising and producing consumer-centric as well as B2B technology and technology-enabled products from level zero. As a result, I am open to exploring exciting full-stack development opportunities in startups as well as companies with scale.
